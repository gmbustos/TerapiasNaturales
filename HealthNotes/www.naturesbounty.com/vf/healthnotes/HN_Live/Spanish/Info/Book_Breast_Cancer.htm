<p><em>Breast Cancer: What You Should Know (But May Not Be Told) About Prevention, Diagnosis,
and Treatment</em> (Prima, 1994) by Steve Austin, ND, and Cathy Hitchcock, MSW</p>

<p>This is considered the primary book written for women with breast cancer that covers what
is known about the use of natural medicine. This book also covers the basics of conventional
diagnosis and treatment, explaining the pros and cons of various diagnostic and treatment
possibilities from a neutral position in order to help patients make decisions from a place of
knowledge rather than ignorance.</p>
